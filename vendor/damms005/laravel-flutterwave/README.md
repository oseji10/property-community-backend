This repo is a needful copy (not fork) of [Kingflamez's Flutterwave package](https://github.com/kingflamez/laravelrave) because the upstream does not always release upgrades for new Laravel version compatibility in good time.


## Recommendation

Use [Laravel Multipay](https://github.com/damms005/laravel-multipay) for better experience. It depends on this repo as a [VCS repo](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#vcs) and is well documented, maintained, receives regular updates, and provides interface for other payment providers.
